Sara Hendren is an artist, design researcher, writer, and professor at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu). She is the author of [What Can A Body Do?

Sara is a humanist in tech. ([You can find a bunch of her design lab projects here](http://aplusa.org/).) Her work of 2010-2020 includes collaborative
public art, social design, and writing that reframes
the human body and technology. You might be interested in:
