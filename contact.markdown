Please do get in touch! I'd love to hear from you. I'm on sabbatical leave from my post at Olin College in 2021-22, so I'm unavailable for most events Andâ€”after ten years, I'm no longer on Twitter. If you like, I'll send you occasional news via Substack. Sign up is [here](https://sarahendren.substack.com/).

Speaking requests go through Kate Berner (kberner@penguinrandomhouse.com) at [Penguin Random House Speakers Bureau](https://www.prhspeakers.com/about-us). Media inquiries go through Shailyn Tavella at Riverhead (stavella@penguinrandomhouse.com).
