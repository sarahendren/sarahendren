Finishing up my syllabi this week, and I've lightly adapted the terrific class credos from my likeminded colleague in disability + tech at McGill, [Jonathan Sterne](https://sterneworks.org/). 

**More than one thing can be true**: Strong analysis only works if it’s possible to hold
onto apparently contradictory ideas at once, and explain how they can both be
true in specific circumstances.

**No bullshit**: We will avoid easy, prepackaged explanations of complex phenomena, and
we will greet the claims of all our sources as open to interpretation, as tools to think with. We’ll start with [critical assent](https://sarahendren.com/2022/05/16/critical-assent/). We will also not bullshit one another.

**You have the right to be wrong**: Part of learning is changing one’s own perspective.
This is only possible where ideas can be expressed and challenged, and people
are allowed to change their minds. 

**It’s everyone’s job to imagine a better world**: Any critique of how something *is* raises
the question of how it ought to be. You will be asked to think carefully and
imaginatively about alternatives to the way things are.

**Follow the golden rule**: Treat others as you would want to be treated.
