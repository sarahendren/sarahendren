The best Thanksgiving thing we did as a family the last couple of years was this "who taught me" exercise from Austin Kleon's [gratitude zine](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/a-gratitude-zine).

Just this form — "thanks to" some person, "who taught me" something memorable, times three — serves as a beautiful window into, say, the last year of your kids' developmental lives. A lesson learned, a funny story, a surprising revelation. We'll do this every year and save them from now on as a mini scrapbook. Recommended, for Thanksgiving or even for a New Year's Eve looking-back activity.
