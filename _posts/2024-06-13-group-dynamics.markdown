I guess three's a pattern, right? I just finished William Egginton's *[The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of Reality](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678831/the-rigor-of-angels-by-william-egginton/)* and loved it so much. A stunner â€” beautifully structured, keenly insightful, just astonishing. And then I realized that it joins a couple other profoundly meaningful books for me in the last many years that are also group biographies: Ben Lipscomb's *[The Women Are Up To Something: How Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley, and Iris Murdoch Revolutionized Ethics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-women-are-up-to-something-9780197541074?cc=us&lang=en&)* and Paul Elie's *[The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374529215/thelifeyousavemaybeyourown)* (on Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, Flannery O'Connor, and Walker Percy). Something about this form is really for me, I guess. So after I go back to fiction for a bit, I'll add others to my list:

Hoftstader: *[Godel, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567)* (obligatory, seems like, at this point)

Jacobs: *[The Year of Our Lord 1943: Christian Humanism in an Age of Crisis](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-year-of-our-lord-1943-9780190864651?cc=us&lang=en&)* (on Maritain, Eliot, Lewis, Auden, Weil)

Mann: *[The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow's World](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220698/the-wizard-and-the-prophet-by-charles-c-mann/)* (on Norman Borlaug and William Vogt)

Raboteau: *[American Prophets: Seven Religious Radicals and Their Struggle for Social and Political Justice](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691164304/american-prophets)* (on Heschel, A.J. Muste, Day, Howard Thurman, Merton, King, Fannie Lou Hamer)

Lindley: *[Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/101691/uncertainty-by-david-lindley/)*

Eichler: *[Time's Echo: The Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Music of Remembrance](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576272/times-echo-by-jeremy-eichler/)* (on Strauss, Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten)
