My new newsletter has an exercise I do with students on describing the built world. That's [here](https://sarahendren.substack.com/p/vocab-lesson). But then someone asked me about using these lists in class, and it reminded me that I'd asked a student a year ago if I could use a snapshot of her list-with-modifications after the class took walks around our campus, taking photos and indexing adjectives. I love seeing the mind at work:

![a list of words in a column like "clinical" and "elegant" and "stolid," to which my student has added handwritten circles around some words and her own "silent," "suffocating," and others.jpeg](/uploads/word%20list-1ac416.jpeg)
