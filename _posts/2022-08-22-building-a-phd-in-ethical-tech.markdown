Excerpt from [my interview](https://www.olin.edu/articles/building-purpose-how-craft-phd-ethical-tech) with Olin alum [Emily Wang](https://www.oberlin.edu/emily-wang), who just finished her PhD in HCI at Northwestern and is now heading to Oberlin for her first job. Here she's talking about building a dissertation with strong principles from disability studies and a human-centered prototyping process, including close observation to the adaptive human behaviors that are always already-present:

>Sara: Yes—I love this. I think too many young technologists and designers might skip over the attentive, ethnographic-style interview that makes visible these deeply adaptive behaviors that are already present. It makes your design work so much more robust. And then you turned that research into a pragmatic technological tool, right? 
>
>Emily: Yes! My interviewees’ adaptations informed what I did and didn’t build. I developed Jargon Manager, a software toolkit with a browser extension to opportunistically save terms while reading and a word processor extension that provides a custom autocomplete interface based on the previously saved content. The focus of the project wasn't to make a better algorithmic proofreader, but rather to increase the tailorability of text entry interfaces. There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all writing tool, so the data in each writer’s Jargon Manager is going to be unique. The technological contribution is the stronger integration of a writer’s local context and their tools, which goes beyond what’s currently available with the “Add to dictionary” button in spell checkers. 
>
>The final part of my dissertation was deploying the Jargon Manager toolkit with Alex, the colleague who sparked my initial curiosity in this topic. We did a design-for-one assessment where Alex used the tool over seven months for writing his dissertation chapters. We had monthly check-ins to discuss: “How’s the writing process going? How is this toolkit helping? How is it not helping? How can we make it better?”
