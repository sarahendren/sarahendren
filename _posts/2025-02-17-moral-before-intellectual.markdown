Deep into MacIntyre now â€” not as my first rodeo, but now with a kind of synthesis in mind alongside other big intellectual shifts of my last several years. Here he is in *Dependent Rational Animals*:

>We may at any point go astray in our practical reasoning because of intellectual error: perhaps we happen to be insufficiently well-informed about the particulars of our situation; or we have gone beyond the evidence in a way that has misled us; or we have relied too heavily on some unsubstantiated generalization. But we may also go astray because of moral error: we have been over-influenced by our dislike of someone; we have projected onto a situation some fantasy in whose grip we are; we are insufficiently sensitive to someone else's suffering. And our intellectual errors are often, although not always, rooted in our moral errors. For both types of mistake the best protections are friendship and collegiality.
