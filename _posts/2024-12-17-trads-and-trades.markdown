My friend (and co-designer of this web site!) Jarrett Fuller writes [about his new class on the mediated nature of contemporary politics](https://www.jarrettfuller.blog/2024/12/design-media-politics/):

>Since I arrived at NC State, I’ve been teaching a class in the Spring I created called “Publishing and Distribution.” As the class has evolved, it’s become a way for me to explore these intersections in an attempt, I hope, to find design’s role in this current media and political moment.

>If I can summarize my thesis for the class...it’d be this: politics (and especially national politics) has become a fully mediated activity. It’s something we experience and participate in, almost entirely, through media.
>
>With this in mind, I’ve wanted to spend more time thinking about the aesthetics of politics. By aesthetics, I don’t mean campaign branding, but the actualizing, visually and culturally, of a political ideology. 

This is a really interesting framework for thinking through design's role in the replication and distribution of images, and I'll be eager to follow along.
