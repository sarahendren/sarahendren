The opposite of jargon is not "plain language." It is *sparkling lucidity*. Too many academics translate from theory to the everyday by employing a kind of verbal shrug â€” they say, *Don't be afraid of this fancy term here. It just means*... [insert mealy-mouthed generalities]. The shrug is an attempt at intellectual democratization, I'm sure, but there's no "just" about it. A thinker must actually go much more deeply *toward* the theoretical, turn its ideas like a jewel in her palm, slowly, with great understanding, to then lay out its provocations for the non-specialist reader. The reader can always handle the full complexity of the idea, no matter how abstract. Academics flatter themselves that they can speak "plainly," but plainness is not the project.
