This will be my home base for the next three years, thanks to a residency fellowship. Let this be a starting anew.

No more tightly controlled gestures! No more melancholy lyricism! No more tentativeness, timidity, "thoughtfulness." Enough with elegiac poesis, gentle suggestions, careful obeisance. No more *loveliness*. Start now.
