This week I had architecture students reading about rural and remote spaces. Among other things, they looked at the terrific work of [Rural Studio](https://bittersoutherner.com/rural-studio-turns-20), Rebecca Solnit's *A Field Guide to Getting Lost*, and essays by Wendell Berry. I also included [this interview](https://greattransition.org/publication/for-love-of-place) with Berry, which cites an abbreviated version of his "agrarian values." I asked students to identify the ideas that are not explicitly environmental, in the familiar green-rhetoric sense, and to speculate about why they might be part of Berry's wider vision. We had one of the best conversations all semester thanks to the provocations below:

1. An elated, loving interest in the use and care of the land.

2. An informed and conscientious submission to nature.

3. The wish to have and to belong to a place of oneâ€™s own, as the only secure source of sustenance and independence.

4. A persuasion in favor of economic democracy; a preference for enough over too much.

5. Fear and contempt of waste of every kind, and its ultimate consequence in land exhaustion.

6. A preference for saving rather than spending.

7. An assumption of the need for a subsistence or household economy.

8. An acknowledged need for neighbors, and a willingness to be a good neighbor.

9. A living sense of the need for continuity of family and community life.

10. Respect for work, and (as self-respect) for good work.

11. A lively suspicion of anything new, contradicting the ethos of consumerism and the cult of celebrity.
