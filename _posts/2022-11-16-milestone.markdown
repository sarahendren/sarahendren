Next April I'll turn fifty and I'm...starting over? Have the odd sensation that I've learned nothing at all in adulthood? Have perhaps been sleepwalking through? It's a weird place to be, though probably some well-worn form of midlife whatever-whatever. But my work is changing (research interests), my life-stage is changing (teenagers!), and most of all my inner landscape of faith is changing â€” though this last is more like Chesterton's ship captain who sets out to see the world and "discovers" only his own familiar home shore: "What could be more delightful than to have in the same few minutes all the fascinating terrors of going abroad combined with all the humane security of coming home again?" I'll try to say more about this as I can understand it, though I suspect it will take more hindsight than I'll have for a while.
