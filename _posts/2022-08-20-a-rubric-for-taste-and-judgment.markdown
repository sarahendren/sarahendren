[Alan posted](https://blog.ayjay.org/taste-and-judgment/) a nice heuristic from W.H. Auden on Taste vs Judgment, which I think will be an excellent primer for the students in my [nonfiction class this fall](https://sarahendren.com/2022/07/05/tour-guides-persuaders-portraitists/):

>As readers, we remain in the nursery stage so long as we cannot distinguish between Taste and Judgment, so long, that is, as the only possible verdicts we can pass on a book are two: this I like; this I don’t like.
>
>For an adult reader, the possible verdicts are five: I can see this is good and I like it; I can see this is good but I don’t like it; I can see this is good and, though at present I don’t like it, I believe that with perseverance I shall come to like it; I can see that this is trash but I like it; I can see that this is trash and I don’t like it.
