In middle age, looking back, it is the subtlest shift that shifts everything: from the late adolescent who says *I really must choose the best path* to the young adult who says *I chose the best path, at least for me* to, finally, simply: *I chose.* I chose and it might have been otherwise. I chose, with some combination of seeking prudence and exercising heedless whimsy and life arriving in its made-available forms. The forms made *un*available still stand â€” somewhere, uncountable. If my choices had been different, everything would have been just...*different*: a quantum rippling.
