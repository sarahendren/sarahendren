I had a new newsletter all queued up to publish this morning. I worked hard on it, kept revisiting the sentences, cutting and clarifying, listening for the musicality. It had some virtues! I have thirty other drafts besides. But last night I just thought: Nope. I don't want to write like that anymore. My newsletter writing — and thereby my *thinking* — has been, well, the dreaded  "thoughtful," perhaps clever at best. But would I sign up for my newsletter? I wouldn't. (Someone described my book as having "sentences infused with tenderness." This person meant it as a compliment, but I just thought: *gag*, I think that's true?)

I put out an enormous amount of work this year. An essay in [this book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048651/interrogative-design/). An essay in [that book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Get-in-the-Game/The-San-Francisco-Museum-of-Modern-Art/9781962098038). A whole short documentary film that premiered in [this exhibition](https://museum-gestaltung.ch/en/exhibition/design-all-diversity-norm) (though no one else seems very interested in it). Speaking gigs and fellowships. I have a book in the works, but my vocation as mother with three kids still at home means I'm only planning to really write it in a season when I can get time off 
teaching. That might be soon, but it might be later. And meanwhile, what is that newsletter doing? [Stock and flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/), maybe. But I'm just going to stop for a while. In anticipation of my last milestone birthday, I wrote that I want to [make art, not arguments](https://sarahendren.com/2022/12/19/art-not-argument/). I have a whole beautiful studio and ideas forming in my head. Time to let most things lie fallow and start over.
