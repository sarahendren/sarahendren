Abraham Joshua Heschel, cited in the "Time" chapter of Iain McGilChrist's *[The Matter With Things](https://channelmcgilchrist.com/matter-with-things/)*:

>We are all infatuated with the splendor of space, with the grandeur of things of space. **Thing** is a category that lies heavy on our minds, tyrannizing all our thoughts... Reality to us is thinghood, consisting of substances that occupy space; even God is conceived by most of us as a thing. The result of our thinginess is our blindness to all reality that fails to identify itself as a thing, as a matter of fact. This is obvious in our understanding of time, which, being thingless and insubstantial, appears to us as if it had no reality.

And:

>there is no equivalent for the word "thing" in biblical Hebrew. The word "*davar*," which in later Hebrew came to denote thing, means in biblical Hebrew: speech; word; message; report; tidings; advice; request; promise; decision; sentence; theme, story; saying, utterance; business, occupation; acts; good deeds; events; way, manner; reason, cause; but never "thing." Is this a sign of linguistic poverty, or rather an indication of an unwarped view of the world, of not equating reality (derived from the Latin word *res*, thing) with thinghood?
