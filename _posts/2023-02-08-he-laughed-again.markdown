By some strange serendipity, I happen to be reading the Lord of the Rings books for the first time, and I'm reading them alongside [Adam Roberts](https://medium.com/adams-notebook/tolkien-reread-1-the-ring-sets-out-522fed0da572), who is [in conversation with Alan Jacobs](https://blog.ayjay.org/44273-2/) about all things fantasy. And even [Robin Sloan is in on this](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/sunshine-skyway/) â€” for each of these fine thinkers, a re-read. I'll be tracking along with their thoughts. 

But I daresay I have it best, in the end, because I'm reading it aloud to my 12-year-old son, Malcolm. What a joy it is to discover this author alongside a child at an age when so many discover it. We are reading it slowly, in part because I never want this time together to end. Malcolm's voice is still young, his body still slight, and I will be wrecked when this last of my babies is no longer such. 

Much to love about the end of *The Two Towers*, but these lines are still banging around my head:

>[Sam]: ... I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in one, of course, but I mean: put into words you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And people will say: "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring!" And they'll say: "Yes, that's one my favorite stories. Frodo was very brave, wasn't he, dad?" "Yes, my boy, the famousest of hobbits, and that's saying a lot."
>
>"It's saying a lot too much," said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them.
>
>But Frodo did not heed them; he laughed again.
