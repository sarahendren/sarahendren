My friend Leah Libresco Sargeant [does a close read of abortion cases, medical neglect, and media representation in *Commonplace*](https://commonplace.org/2025/01/27/pro-life-laws-didnt-kill-these-women/). I wish everyone would read this; it's Leah at her razor-sharp best. She's the rare journalist who reads the *actual case files* and thinks through the full extent of the logic:

>This should be a natural point of collaboration for pro-life and pro-choice women. Doctors shouldn’t be able to hide behind abortion laws to cover for poor care. Abortion isn’t a solution to the vulnerability of poor or undocumented women who hope to hold their child, but fear their doctors. These women’s preventable deaths should provoke a medical reckoning. A doctor should safeguard a woman and her child together, not pit them against each other.
