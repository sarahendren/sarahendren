[Alan Jacobs](https://mbird.com/religion/prayer/spells-and-prayers/):

>I often tell my students that whether Christianity is true or not, it is the most *unnatural* religion in the world. Even a cursory study of the world’s religions will show how obsessed humans are with finding some way to (a) gain the favor of the gods, or transhuman powers of any kind, and/or (b) avert their wrath. Religious seeking is almost always about these two universal desires: to get help and to avert trouble. But in Christianity it is *God* who comes to seek and save the lost (Lk 19:10); it is *God* who reckons with His own wrath, himself making propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world (1 Jn 2:2). The standard — or rather the *obsessive* — practices of [*homo religiosus*](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-6086-2_308) have no place here. In Jesus Christ, the Christian gospel says, God has done it all.

>I say: This may be true or it may be false, but it is the Christian account of things, and it is very, very weird — so weird that it is easy, indeed *natural*, for us to fall back on the standard model of religion and turn our prayers into spells. How often do we think, perhaps in some unacknowledged place deep inside our minds and hearts, that when we come to church and say the appointed words and perform the correct actions, we are somehow getting Management to take our side?
