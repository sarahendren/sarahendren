Malcolm and I finished *Lord of the Flies* last month, [after *Animal Farm](https://sarahendren.com/2022/07/06/a-story-above-all/)* (brilliant, as though written yesterday) and *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (what's all the fuss about??). *Lord of the Flies* was harrowing, of course, and unlike Orwell, William Golding has a pretty baroque style that meant that Malcolm followed along fine, but missed plenty of expressive passages laden with early 20th century words.

>"It's really a very pleasant city," said Alec as he strolled down the street, pointing out several of the sights, which didn't seem to be there, and tipping his cap to the passers-by. There were great crowds of people rushing along with their heads down, and they all appeared to know exactly where they were going as they darted around and down the nonexistent streets and in and out of the missing buildings.

>"I don't see any city," said Milo very softly.

>"Neither do they," Alec remarked sadly, "but it hardly matters, for they don't miss it at all."
