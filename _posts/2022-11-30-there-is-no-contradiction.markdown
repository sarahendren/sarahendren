[From the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-63744073):

>Under current legislation for England, Wales and Scotland, there is a 24-week time limit for abortion, unless "there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped," which includes Down's syndrome.
>
[Heidi] Crowter, who has [Down syndrome], argued that the rules were discriminatory to people with Down's. She said the legislation "doesn't respect my life" and brought a case against the government at the High Court in July 2021 with Maire Lea-Wilson, 33, from west London, whose son Aidan has Down's syndrome.
>
>Ms Crowter said she and her team plan to "keep fighting" and take the case to the Supreme Court and "fight there."
>
>In a summary of the decision, by Lord Justice Underhill, Lady Justice Thirlwall and Lord Justice Peter Jackson, the judges said: "The court recognises that many people with Down's Syndrome and other disabilities will be upset and offended by the fact that a diagnosis of serious disability during pregnancy is treated by the law as a justification for termination, and that they may regard it as implying that their own lives are of lesser value.
>
>"But it holds that a perception that that is what the law implies is not by itself enough to give rise to an interference with article 8 rights (to private and family life, enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights)," the judges said.
>
>Clare Murphy, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS, which provides abortion care services, said it supported the court's verdict.
>
>"There is no contradiction between a society which champions the rights of disabled people and one which allows women to make difficult decisions in heart-breaking situations," she said.

It's true that one can arrive at something like half a dozen mixed positions about selective termination and Down syndrome: the morality of the act of abortion itself, the act when it comes to genetic abnormalities, a theory of change that persuades or legislates or constitutionally declares, the role of the state's interests in protecting life (where there is deemed to *be* life), and so on. 

But more people could at least acknowledge that there *is* a contradiction — an irreducible contradiction — between the freedoms and protections for disabled people and the "bodily autonomy" principle that is the bedrock of most abortion rights justification. Selective termination means that a wanted fetus became an unwanted one. It's the reason so few people on the left will touch this issue: Selectivity means that there once had been an implicit *human* in the balance, and now there is a clump of undesired cells. 

Yes, for heaven's sake, it's complicated! But remember that [abortion in the case of Down syndrome is highest in wealthy welfare states](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/the-last-children-of-down-syndrome/616928/), and that making routine genetic screening for Down syndrome a default part of prenatal care seems to powerfully shape the entire matter: Down syndrome as merely risk and deficit and brokenness. I can't get more than *crickets* out of anyone in progressive circles, and that includes most people in the disability rights community.
