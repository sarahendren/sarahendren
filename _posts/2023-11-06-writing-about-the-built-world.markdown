I'm teaching a course for graduate students in design next spring called Writing About the Built World. It's got an architecture focus, but I'll be including design criticism and tech criticism too. If you have favorite essays, films, books, or podcasts â€” especially from outside the ordinary venues and outside the strict genre boundaries of criticism, I'd love to hear them. Like Rachel Kushner's devastating and beautiful "[Street Life](https://harpers.org/archive/2023/08/street-life/)" from Harper's this year. Do please reach out! s dot hendren at northeastern dot edu.
