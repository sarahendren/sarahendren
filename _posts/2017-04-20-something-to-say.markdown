Last year I read—inhaled, really—the newest novel from Ann Patchett, [Commonwealth](http://shop.harvard.com/book/9780062491794). I went deep into interviews with Patchett afterwards, including this great conversation [on the Lit Up podcast](http://thelitupshow.com/episode-71-ann-patchett-on-step-families-lasting-bonds-and-more/), from whence this snippet comes:

> "People love to ask—everyone—can writing be taught? And I always believe: I can teach you how to write dialogue. I can teach you how to write a plot; I can teach you how to write a clear image. I can do all sorts of things to technically improve almost anyone as a writer. But I cannot teach you how to have something to say."
