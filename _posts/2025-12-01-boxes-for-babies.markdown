Alexandra Lange on Mamdani's (and Adams's) [baby boxes in NYC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-12/mayor-eric-adams-introduces-a-new-york-twist-on-finland-s-baby-boxes?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) and their Finnish origins. A long overdue idea in the US:
>
>The outside of the NYC Baby Boxes — the ones spearheaded by Adams’s City Hall — features a custom graphic of the cityscape, including brownstones, tenements, elevator buildings and the distinctive spires of the Chrysler Building and One World Trade. Same for the many-pocketed canvas diaper bag inside the box. Floating above the graphics are abstract sleeping babies, well swaddled and capped. A proprietary onesie and hat declare, “NYC loves me.”

>Also in the box: gauze swaddles, starred one-piece PJs and more gender-neutral onesies, plus almost 100 diapers in two sizes, diaper rash cream, three packages of wipes, a towel and Cetaphil baby wash, a thermometer and grooming kit. For the birthing parent there are maxipads, nursing pads and soothing lanolin ointment. Guides for mothers and new families plus a copy of Margaret Hurd Brown’s classic *Goodnight Moon*, provided by United Way of New York City, round out the offerings.
