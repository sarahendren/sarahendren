I thought [this piece by David Frum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/american-historical-association-james-sweet/671853/) was thoroughly reported and patiently considered:

>Sweet used a play on words — “Is History History?” — for the title of his complacency-shaking essay. But he was asking not whether history is finished, done with, but Is history still history? Is it continuing to do what history is supposed to do? Or is it being annexed for other purposes, ideological rather than historical ones? These are uncomfortable but important questions. If it is not the job of the president of the American Historical Association to confront those questions, then whose is it?
