What I said in the comments section of [Freddie's new post](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/what-do-people-with-disabilities):

>I've been teaching design and disability for the last dozen years and am the parent of a teenager with Down syndrome. Much has changed in the small world of online rhetoric and in elite university practice in that time, as you've documented. In the last couple of years, I'm finding students CAN see how improbable the ballooning ADHD numbers are, CAN recognize the social media distortions of self-dx, etc. They're caught in it. But they do see something's off, and most of them crave good hard conversations about how to make sense. My main conclusion is this: when we jump from tangible reasonable accommodations to the vague and immaterial need to get "beyond" access, focus on stigma, medicalize ordinary human variation, it's partly a signal that schools and cultural institutions have abandoned any sustained attention to the question of suffering. Is suffering a given, non-optional part of life? Or is it a glitch in the body-as-machine? How do we distinguish our ordinary suffering from the unacceptable, and what do families and cultures and states do about it? Philosophical and ancient wisdom traditions are ready with insight, but schools don't teach these domains. So we stretch the logic of accommodations far beyond what it can hold. We speak in the thinnest therapeutic language for all our troubles. We resign ourselves to the ever-receding goalposts that hold something like "belonging," because we can't imagine shoring up forms of life outside the machines-and-markets shape of the modern world.

I'll just add here some explanatory context for my fellow professors and teachers trying to navigate this weird terrain we're in, if those counterparts want to accompany students and ward off their own bitterness. (I see and hear a *lot* of bitterness.) 

Consider that: 

— The history of the ADA is a rights-based movement that had, at its core, a strong claim that people are more than patients. Human dignity, of course, is an old idea. But global industrial modernity brought us a heritage of institutions and asylums built to *manage* people with disabilities, and the 1960s-era disability rights movement was an effort to redress those ills. No more hiding people away from civic life. 

— More than half a century later, rich countries' welfare structures have guaranteed a lot of tangible goods for that (re)-entry into civic life, and the public-private mix of technology, design, and policy is a fascinating nexus of human creativity and meaningful invention. Ramps, curb cuts, closed captioning. The software-hardware mix of a smart phone is a life-changing tool for my friends who are blind or deaf, who have no finger digits or one arm, all kinds of atypicalities. We should preserve our wonder at these tools.

— Our era also contains deep and unresolved paradoxes. The legacy of the disability rights movement unfolding in high modernity means that 1) today is a great historical moment to live as someone, say, with Down syndrome, while 2) Down syndrome is [being designed out of the world](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/the-last-children-of-down-syndrome/616928/). Today the resources and forms of assistance for mental health disorders are abundant, while many nations debate medically assisted suicide for treatment-resistant depression, say, in teenagers. Technologies help mediate both deliberate inclusion and a eugenic culling of bodily dependence from the imaginary of the common good. 

— The long arc of demedicalizing disability in the rich countries of the West is meeting with another paradox: the *re*medicalizing and indeed pathologizing of all human variation.
