What I said in the comments section of [Freddie's new post](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/what-do-people-with-disabilities):

>I've been teaching design and disability for the last dozen years and am the parent of a teenager with Down syndrome. Much has changed in the small world of online rhetoric and in elite university practice in that time, as you've documented. In the last couple of years, I'm finding students CAN see how improbable the ballooning ADHD numbers are, CAN recognize the social media distortions of self-dx, etc. They're caught in it. But they do see something's off, and most of them crave good hard conversations about how to make sense. My main conclusion is this: when we jump from tangible reasonable accommodations to the vague and immaterial need to get "beyond" access, focus on stigma, medicalize ordinary human variation, it's partly a signal that schools and cultural institutions have abandoned any sustained attention to the question of suffering. Is suffering a given, non-optional part of life? Or is it a glitch in the body-as-machine? How do we distinguish our ordinary suffering from the unacceptable, and what do families and cultures and states do about it? Philosophical and ancient wisdom traditions are ready with insight, but schools don't teach these domains. So we stretch the logic of accommodations far beyond what it can hold. We speak in the thinnest therapeutic language for all our troubles. We resign ourselves to the ever-receding goalposts that hold something like "belonging," because we can't imagine shoring up forms of life outside the machines-and-markets shape of the modern world.

I'll just add here some advice for my fellow professors and teachers trying to navigate this weird terrain we're in, if those counterparts want to accompany students and ward off bitterness. (I see and hear a *lot* of bitterness.) 

You might remind students that the history of the ADA is a rights-based movement that had, at its core, a strong claim that people are more than patients. Human dignity, of course, is an old idea. But global industrial modernity brought us a heritage of institutions and asylums built to *manage* people with disabilities, and the 1960s-era disability rights movement was an effort to redress those ills. No more hiding people away from civic life.
