Misha Valdman [on philosopher Derek Parfit and "the repugnant conclusion" of all our earnest efforts](https://zworld.substack.com/p/could-i-make-you-eat-shit?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) — you should probably read that post to make sense of the following, but anyway:

>Humanity suffers from the crippling problem that it’s always possible to make things x-er (bigger, better, stronger, clearer). That, plus the desire, is all the repugnant conclusion needs to turn goodness into badness, strength into weakness, reason into madness, clarity into mud, A to B to C and all the way to Z. It targets governments, bureaucracies and institutions but it targets people too. We’re all trying to make ourselves x-er along some dimension or other, moving along a continuum, making incremental improvements and each time adding just a little bit of shit. And shit accumulates. Marx thought that capitalism would collapse under the weight of its own shit (its own “contradictions,” as he lovingly put it). The repugnant conclusion shouts back: so shall you all!

I just picked up David Edmonds's biography of Parfit, so Valdman's essay is timely, if juuuuust out of my intellectual grasp. But it brought to mind immediately this conversation between the Know Your Enemy guys and Christian Wiman.
