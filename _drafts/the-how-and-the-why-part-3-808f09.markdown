In Wendell Berry's incomparable novel [Jayber Crow](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/674667/jayber-crow-by-wendell-berry/), an exchange happens between the young Jayber, then at a religious college, and a professor named Dr. Ardmire. Jayber had been laboring under the impression that maybe he was called into religious ministry full time, but while in school, he loses this call. He goes to Ardmire to talk it out:

>"So, I said, I reckon it all comes down to this, how can I preach if I don't have any ansers?"
>
>"Yes, Mr. Crow," he said. "How can you?" He was not one of your frying-size chickens.
>
>"I don't believe I can," I said, and I felt my skin turn cold, for I had not even though that until then."
>
>He said, "No, I don't believe you can." And we sat there and looked at each other again while he waited for me to see the next thing, so he wouldn't have to tell me: I oughtn't to waste any time resigning my scholarship and leaving Pigeonville. I saw it soon enough.
>
>I said, "Well," for now I was ashamed, "I had this feeling maybe I had been called."
>
"And you may have been right. But not to what you thought. Not to what you think. You have been given questions to which you cannot be *given* answers. You will have to live them out — perhaps a little at a time." 
>
>"And how long is that going to take?"
>
>"I don't know. As long as you live, perhaps."
>
>"That could be a long time."
>
>"I will tell you a further mystery," he said. "It may take longer."

This dialogue is the bit we're all supposed to wonder at — the idea that the mystery of how any one life adds up is probably not calculable. It exceeds our grasp, and maybe indeed our time on the planet. But the memorable line for me happens just after: Jayber, filled with gratitude, "turned around. I was going to thank him, but he had gone back to his book."

The professor had gone back to his book! No mystical mood hung in the air. No prolonged and meaningful parting ensues. For Professor Ardmire, a conversation with a young person about the nature of ultimate things was important but also *ordinary*, not exceptional.

It has taken nearly 30 years away from college for me to fully appreciate that I had this same ordinariness at Wheaton. First-order questions were on the table. They were everyday matters in the classroom and in the offices of my professors: What is life about? What is goodness and wisdom? Is there a God? Is one's life one's own, or does it belong to some larger tapestry? And some of this ordinariness played out in Wheaton's core curriculum, which required some basics in theology and Biblical studies for all students. I would most certainly have avoided those classes if given the choice, but a couple of the books I read in them have been some of the most lasting and formative of my life since.

Wheaton shaped some of my friends into full-time ministers. Others it helped leave Christianity behind, not in spite of its structure, but because of it. Insist on first-order matters and young people will arrive in all kinds of places in their search for truth — in their short four years in one direction, and in ten years hence somewhere else, and in another twenty years, perhaps somewhere else again. But the insistence on the seriousness of the questions — the affirmation to young people that their own late-night existential questions are real and necessary — was paramount on our (flawed, very human) campus.




On a long road trip with my friend Sandra, she told me a story about her own time at Wheaton that brought this home.
