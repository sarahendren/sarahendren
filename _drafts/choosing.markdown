In middle age it is the subtlest shift in looking back that shifts everything: from the late adolescent who says *I am choosing the best path* to the young adult who says *I chose the best path for me* to, finally, simply, in middle age: *I chose.* I chose and it might have been otherwise. I chose and life arrived in its made-available forms. The forms made-unavailable still stand aside. If my choices had been different, everything would have been just...*different*: a quantum rippling.
