I share so many foundational commitments [with this doctor](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/community/education/schooling-me-the-surgeon), but when will well-meaning Christians learn to discipline their language about disabled people? The person-as-object-lesson is just too tidy to resist, it seems: 

>[T]hey live closer to the cross than the rest of us. They carry their disabilities all the time. They don’t get a day off. They don’t get a minute off... And so I find they bring me closer to the cross. They feel it; they sense it; they’re part of it more than I am. I sometimes have to think my way there, whereas they simply guide me – they take me by the hand and bring me there.

*They* show us, *they* teach us, *they* tell us — this language runs through the whole piece. Really? Who is this *they*? People with Down syndrome will always be trotted out in these narratives, I find — and, in fairness, it's partly [to counter the soft eugenics arguments](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/the-last-children-of-down-syndrome/616928/) that are diminishing the number of babies born with that condition. What about a man who's had a sudden catastrophic hearing loss in his 60s? A woman in her twenties who had rheumatoid arthritis that's now in remission? An amputee? Someone living with a low-lying malaise of depression for decades on end? 

The Christian framework does offer sacrifice as an inevitable part of life and an invitation, both. We hold our many sufferings and let them be united with the sacrificial Love that precedes and subsumes it. And yes, disabling conditions may well show up in the Venn diagram of our suffering and our sacrifices; like all givenness in life, those conditions can also be gifts if seen in light of that same Love. All of that mix — our gifts and our suffering as sacrifice — conjoin us to one another as no more and no less than human. If some abstract *they* is used to teach an edifying lesson, you can be sure that we're dealing with flat characters: cardboard cutouts and allegorical symbols, not human beings. 

But of course we *do* teach other. The old idea from Iris Murdoch endures: the most important revelation that fiction offers is that other people exist. The news is half comedy and half tragedy. Other people exist! A miraculous banality, and one that takes rituals and habits to take seriously.
