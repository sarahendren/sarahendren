Explaining emotivism to a teenager:

Right now you think of moral decisions in your own life as stable and laudable. If pressed for the *source* of moral instincts, you respond with a normative claim: that you do some recognizably good deeds for others. You give gifts and support to your friends. You ask after someone who's clearly struggling. You yield to others in a line. You avoid being an asshole and eke out some generous acts on a regular basis. Why must everyone make a big deal about guilt or sin and confession, or the need to practice an ethics of virtue or obligation? If it isn't hard for *you*, now in adolescence, and if you have instincts that guide your actions with something like an active conscience, then what's all the fuss about? What a needless complexity. Be a good person, you say. It's not that hard.
