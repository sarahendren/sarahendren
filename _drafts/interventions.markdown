I am spending a lot of time these days reminding my students that the digital workplace was invented in my adult lifetime. I'm old, but I'm not *that* old, I tell them. We didn't have personal computers when I was in college; in my senior year, at the computer lab, someone pointed across the room to a friend and reported that somehow, magically, he was sending a message halfway across the world? I didn't give it much thought. And then, two years later when I got my first office temp job, I sat at a desk with a desktop machine and shared one computer and one personal email address with my husband. And now, I remind them, under design principles of efficiency, speed, and omnipresence, we have the forty-open-tabs-and-five-notification-apps kind of default work life. Which includes college student life. The digital workplace wasn't so much designed as flooded, willy nilly, with experimental products. 

I have given more than half a dozen guest lectures in my colleagues' classes in the last 18 months, and every one of them is a sea of laptops. My host colleagues plead with students to please give the guest, me, their full attention. These requests mostly go unheeded. In my own classroom, I *direct* my students, by name if necessary, to close down devices at regular intervals, and certainly when a guest appears in class. But how is it that I'm more or less alone in this decision?
