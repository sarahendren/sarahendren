Reason and virtue, I tell my children — that's why you go to college. That's why you go to college *if* in fact you're the kind of person who could productively encounter the college-shaped delivery of those two goods. They are, of course, available elsewhere. But since you two — you two of our three — are suited for it, off you'll likely go. But we'll all have to keep our eyes open for these two goods to appear in the institutions you choose. It's not at all obvious where you'd go to find them.

What do I mean by reason? The best way I've heard this explained is from my old boss in the 90's, educational psychologist Howard Gardner. When young children hit age four or five, he says, they all charm everyone around them with their big-picture questions. What happens when we die? 

> Immanent activity is of quite a different order. It is the characteristic activity of life and spirit. Here the agent has its own perfection in itself; it elevates itself in being. Immanent action is a self-perfecting quality. The acts of knowing and of loving are not only within the soul, they are for the soul an active superexistence, as it were, superior to the merely physical act of existence. Thus the soul, when it knows, becomes thereby something that it is not, and when it loves, aspires toward what it is not, as to another self. This action, as such, is above time.
