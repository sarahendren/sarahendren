This is the last in my series on thinking about the state of higher education, which I think I'll also summarize in a newsletter. If you're interested:

Buried in a footnote in Lewis Hyde's classic study on gift economies called *[The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-gift-how-the-creative-spirit-transforms-the-world-lewis-hyde/18408257?ean=9781984897787)* is a stirring question that sums up the adventure I hope holds my two college-bound children — at least some of the time — in their years at university. Earlier in the book, Hyde names the gift economy as operating on *eros* in its classical sense, a form of unfettered attachment, a "shaping into one": 

>In the modern world the rights that adults have in their children...normally pass slowly from parent to child during adolescence and become fully vested in the child when he or she is ready to leave home.
>
>If our lives are gifts to begin with, however, in some sense they are not "ours" even when we become adults. Or perhaps they are, but only until such time as we find a way to bestow them. The belief that life is a gift carries with it the corollary feeling that the gift should not be hoarded. As we mature, and particularly as we come into the isolation of being "on our own," we begin to feel the desire to give ourselves away — in love, in marriage, to our work, to the gods, to politics, to our children. And adolescence is marked by that restless, erotic, disturbing inquisition: Is this person, this nation, this work, worthy of the life I have to give?

The best heuristics I can generate for thinking through college operate with this gift disposition as their engine. I think young people need 1) formation (a good number of experiences they don't self-select), 2) readiness (rehearsal experiences for civic mindedness, not just the professions), 3) the prescriptive domains of philosophy and theology (getting beyond everyday issues to the big enduring questions) — all to help young people encounter this life-as-gift invitation. And it's clear to me now that we don't have to look for a one-size-fits-all university structure to see these elements at work. The spaces for learning (that's #4) might be arranged in a few different ways that together provide those first three.

[Here's the to-be-sure part of this piece] Reader: I have been parenting for 18 years, so I'm fully aware that you don't cook up and serve an experience to your children with the expectation that your good intentions will take root in their minds and souls. Trust me. But I do think the question of what kind of college is worth paying for is an important one, given the various muddled mission statements of the contemporary university. I'm doing the best I can — and in the spirit of formation, the best I can requires more than just facilitating my kids' shopping for their choices.

First model: A strong required core curriculum

The big questions and enduring ideas that make up the "great books" style of college go a long way toward formation and readiness, ideally with the prescriptive domains taught with enough primary sources and [critical assent](https://sarahendren.com/2022/05/16/critical-assent/).

One of my godsons is starting his sophomore year at St John's College in Santa Fe, and this is probably the most formative core curriculum on offer: sequential, nearly lockstep all the way through. Everyone takes singing class in the first year! Glorious. We'll be visiting him sometime this year, though I sort of doubt it's the thing for my two college-bound ones.

I'm also a fan of the traditional Jesuit core, since it includes good sophisticated philosophy and theology. It seems like a number of the Jesuit universities are trending like the rest of higher ed — with more choices for meeting broad categorical requirements than prescribed topics — but 

Second model: Opt-in core curriculum

I am very excited by some of the great books-style plans within larger universities:

Notre Dame's [Program of Liberal Studies](https://pls.nd.edu/)
[Honors College at Fordham's Rose Hill campus](https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/program-overview/curriculum-at-a-glance/)
[UT Austin's Plan II program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/)
[Baylor's Honors College](https://honors.baylor.edu/) 
[Marquette's Honors Core program](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/resources-opportunities/marquette-core-curriculum/#requirementstext)

There are first-year programs that offer foundations, like Yale's [Directed Studies program](https://directedstudies.yale.edu/).
