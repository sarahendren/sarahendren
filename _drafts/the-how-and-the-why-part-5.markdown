This is the last in my series on thinking about the state of higher education, which I think I'll also summarize in a newsletter. If you're interested:

Part 1 on formation.
Part 2 on readiness.
Part 3 on prescriptive disciplines.
Part 4 on spaces for learning.

Buried in a footnote in Lewis Hyde's classic study on gift economies called *[The Gift](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-gift-how-the-creative-spirit-transforms-the-world-lewis-hyde/18408257?ean=9781984897787)* is a stirring question that sums up the adventure I hope holds my children — at least some of the time — in their years at university. Hyde has named the gift economy as operating on *eros* in its classical sense, a form of unfettered attachment, as opposed to the *logos* of the transactional market economy.
