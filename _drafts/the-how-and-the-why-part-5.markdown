This is the last in my series on thinking about the state of higher education, which I think I'll also summarize in a newsletter. If you're interested:

Part 1 on formation.
Part 2 on readiness.
Part 3 on prescriptive disciplines.
Part 4 on spaces for learning.

Buried in a footnote in Lewis Hyde's classic study on gift economies called *[The Gift](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-gift-how-the-creative-spirit-transforms-the-world-lewis-hyde/18408257?ean=9781984897787)* is a stirring question that sums up the adventure I hope holds my children — at least some of the time — in their years at university. Hyde has named the gift economy as operating on *eros* in its classical sense, a form of unfettered attachment, as opposed to the *logos* of the transactional market economy.

One of my godsons is starting his sophomore year at St John's in Santa Fe, and this is probably the most formative curriculum on offer: sequential, nearly lockstep all the way through. Everyone takes singing class in the first year! Glorious. We'll be visiting him sometime this year, though I sort of doubt it's the thing for my two college-bound ones.

I am very excited by some of the great books-style plans within larger universities:

Notre Dame's [Program of Liberal Studies](https://pls.nd.edu/)
[Honors College at Fordham's Rose Hill campus](https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/program-overview/curriculum-at-a-glance/)
[UT Austin's Plan II program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/)
[Baylor's Honors College](https://honors.baylor.edu/) 
[Marquette's Honors Core program](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/resources-opportunities/marquette-core-curriculum/#requirementstext)

There are first-year programs that offer foundations, like Yale's [Directed Studies program](https://directedstudies.yale.edu/).

UNC Chapel Hill
University of Florida
