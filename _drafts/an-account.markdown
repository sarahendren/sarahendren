from the almost-sent files:

You are young still, but the question needs posing, even for you: how to account for the suffering of the world. Well, not *account* for it — the immensity resists all sketched economies — but suffering begs for an answering back. Yes, your own suffering, small as it may be, and the historical weight of suffering at large. The utter depravity and harm that comes to innocents, and each of us caught in doing harms to others, small, perhaps — but the suffering we inflict with our ready consent or our willful ignorance.
