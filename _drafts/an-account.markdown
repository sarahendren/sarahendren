from the almost-sent files:

You are young still, but the question needs posing, even for you: how to account for the suffering of the world. Well, not *account* for it — the immensity resists all sketched economies — but suffering begs for an answering back. Yes, your own suffering, small as it may be, and the historical weight of suffering at large. The utter depravity and harm that comes to innocents, and each of us caught in doing harms to others. The suffering, great or small, that we inflict with our ready consent or our willful ignorance.

How pathetically thin is the moral universe in which we say: There *is* no proper accounting, so I will be content with a self-regarding comparative measure of my deeds. *At least I'm not that like that guy*, we say, a dozen times a day. Or worse, we may ricochet between *at least I'm not* and its other end, the noise of vague ambient guilt.  an inner state we return to  obsessively occupying our attention so we can dig no further for the remedy.
