We've talked about [formation](https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/10/the-how-and-the-why/), [readiness](https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/14/the-how-and-the-why-part-2/), and [prescriptive disciplines](https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/21/the-how-and-the-why-part-3/). Today I want to talk about spaces for learning.

In a New York Times [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/02/magazine/wendy-brown-interview.html?searchResultPosition=1), political theorist Wendy Brown addresses some of the uproar about free speech on campus by diagnosing a confusion that comes, in a way, from architecture. Naturally, it caught my eye, and I think her analysis is useful:

>“We’re confused today about what campuses are,” says Brown, who is 66 and is the UPS Foundation Professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. “We’ve lost track of what’s personal and public and what’s acceptable speech where. That confusion happens in part because boundaries are so blurred everywhere.”

And more specifically:

>Campuses are complicated spaces, because they aren’t just one kind of space: There’s the classroom, the dorm, the public space that is the campus. Then there’s what we could call clubs, support centers — identity based or based on social categories or political interests. It’s a terrible mistake to confuse all of these and imagine that the classroom or the public space of the campus is the same as your home.

In architecture, we call the aerial view of a blueprint drawing the *plan* view: seeing the entirety of a structure from above, with a 2D simulacrum of completion, simplified, each container dedicated for its distinct purposes and labeled as such. I think Brown is right that when many of us invoke the word "campus," a plan view in the mind's eye does not distinguish at all. Rather, "campus" registers as one big mass of squares and rectangles and rotundas, all equally devoted to the well-intended mixture of belonging and safety and professional preparation and the life of the mind and recreation — and somehow all adding up to "home away from home" — as one lumped-together design and one united effort. 

Campuses should take a closer look at their spaces and *sharpen* the distinctions of those spaces, maybe even literally in the first-year arrival campus tours.
