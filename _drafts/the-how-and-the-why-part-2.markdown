So we've [looked at formation and freedom](https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/10/the-how-and-the-why/) in the college decision process. I want to examine next the framework of *readiness* in higher education to get at formation in another way — what should four years make a student ready for? I've written [about this subject before](https://sarahendren.substack.com/p/a-classroom-is-for-readiness), but today I want to restate the strengths and add some of the weaknesses of this frame.

Education as readiness is a heuristic developed by the philosopher (and erstwhile [politician](https://partnersindemocracy.us/)!) Danielle Allen, most succinctly laid out in her essay called [What Is Education For?](https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/danielle-allen-what-is-education-for/). For the last several semesters, I've had all my students in every class read this essay for Week 2 discussion, alongside [this blog post about "mental models"](https://www.therealworldofcollege.com/blog/taking-advantage-of-college-before-its-too-late) for students to think about their college experience. This is my small intervention to introduce Formation 101 for young people; it's wonky and over their heads at first, but it creates a shorthand for us to unpack over the course of the term together. 

Allen lays out "professional readiness" as the dominant model for much of higher education today, and she makes an extended argument that "participatory readiness" should include but ultimately supersede professional readiness. Job skills are important, she says, and yes, they create the crucial class mobility — for greater economic equality — that we need for making a more democratic society. But *political* equality, she says, is never achieved by simply equipping more people for more well-paying jobs. Citizens have to be actively enfranchised with habits and practices that enact shared freedom, and for that, education can be an ideal rehearsal space. The readiness to "participate" is what Allen calls for: civic agency, enjoining oneself to the means and ends of equality not just for oneself, but for the larger social fabric and in proper relationship to the nation state.

Allen describes three actions of the democratic civic actor that education should make students ready for: *disinterested deliberation* (think: town halls and other deliberative governance), *fair fighting* (think: protests and lobbying for causes), and my personal favorite, *prophetic reframing* (think: rhetorical re-description of possible civic worlds, as in the speeches of Dr. King). 






It occasions my making an argument for the liberal arts as well, and it's been both disorienting and rather bracing to find that my students aren't defensive about it. They've just never heard this rationale. So we're starting over, at least in my pre-professional settings.
