Once more with feeling: More people should read Yuval Levin's [A Time to Build](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/yuval-levin/a-time-to-build/9781541699281/) on the role of institutions in our lives. No matter where your politics stand, Levin offers such lucid and succinct diagnostics on how institutions get corroded — with ample case studies and data that you'll recognize, I promise — and a strong call to individuals to shore up the bounds of our many institutions, despite their failures, for the benefit of everyone. 

I hear the objections to Levin's strong institutionalism over and over: It is reliably, predictably, maddeningly chic in progressive-left circles *within elite institutions* to disavow the worth of institutions most strenuously. You can rhetorically "win" any group conversation by suggesting that you're not at all interested in officialdom. The archaic edifices of institutions are *not for you*. You're interested in how ordinary people gather and cooperate, unfettered by rules or regulations or norms. As if that's all there is to say: why can't we celebrate and self-organize discontinuous groups of people for their own ends? You win, rhetorically, because it feels, at first glance, anti-elitist to make these claims (which, again, people hasten to signal most loudly from their posts securely *within* elite institutions).
