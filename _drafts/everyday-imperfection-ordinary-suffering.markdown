I've been teaching disability studies and design for more than a decade, and Freddie DeBoer is [right to repeatedly raise the alarm](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/of-course-people-make-up-disabilities) about the warped cultural incentives for questionable disability claims. It's actually worth reading the comments there; the "on the one hand, on the other hand" quality of the discussion is a pretty close transcript of what's ricocheting around my head when these stats come up. 

I confess I didn't see this countertrend in disability "rights" coming — this elite social status accorded to ever-more-refined diagnostics and disorders. A closer read of history might have prepped me better, but of the course the genuinely new variable has been the algorithm-led structure of social media: an openly wanton, experimental marketing of products that mine young people's subjectivity and relationships for profit. 

For the last month in my classroom, I have talked my students through the dynamics of bodies with machines under conditions of disability. Look for closures and openings, I tell them. Disability brings about barriers and hurdles — *closures* in human experience. It also brings the experience of dependence to the generative heart of remaking the built world, a set of *openings* as a cultural inheritance that shapes all of us. These days I also tie those themes to a discussion of the closures and openings more widely made evident under technopoly: What is their own relationship to the digital workplace and its pervasive, liquid, always-on structure? What kinds of sociality are opened up in the apps, and what kinds are distorted or shut down? 

They have plenty of insight for the mixed inheritance of social media. But I wonder if we'll be able to walk all the way to the heart of the matter before the semester's up.

Last week I sat in on a symposium of thinkers discussing the approaches in various global religious and wisdom traditions toward biotechnology. What do these traditions tell us about bodies, persons, the good, or right action that would shape the *yes* or *no* one might say to a given pursuit of biomedicine or technological intervention? One scholar summed up the challenge: the quest for biotechnology is to frame and address imperfection. What counts as imperfection, what are its sources, how much is too much? Is imperfection a problem to solve? A *glitch* in a body or a life that should operate as smoothly and efficiently as machinery? 

Like Joe Davis and others, I worry that [all pathology, all the time](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/all-pathology-all-the-time) both 1) makes rational sense with a mechanistic view of the human person and 2) is a profoundly impoverished view of human life. I think most young people (most people?) would resist the idea that a person is characterizable as a machine. But when pressed, no coherent alternative picture is ready to hand. I think the clamor among young people for diagnostic names for imperfection — every imperfection, from the clinically serious and undertreated to the elaborate neologisms for capturing everything from ordinary variability or performed eccentricity — begs for more sustained philosophical inquiry. If imperfection is *not* a mechanical glitch, what is it? How do we countenance it, make meaning alongside it, make our uneasy peace with its inevitable arrival? Young people need our patient accompaniment to ask these questions. They've already been abandoned once to the algorithms. I won't abandon them again with scorn.
