I've been teaching disability studies and design for more than a decade, and Freddie DeBoer is [right to repeatedly raise the alarm](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/of-course-people-make-up-disabilities) about the warped cultural incentives for questionable disability claims. It's actually worth reading the comments there; the "on the one hand, on the other hand" quality of the discussion is a pretty close transcript of what's ricocheting around my head when these stats come up. 

I confess I didn't see this countertrend in disability "rights" coming — this elite social status accorded to ever-more-refined diagnostics and disorders. A closer read of history might have prepped me better, but of the course the genuinely new variable has been the algorithm-led structure of social media: an openly wanton, experimental marketing of products that mine young people's subjectivity and relationships for profit. 

In my classroom in the last month, I have talked my students through the dynamics of bodies with machines under conditions of disability. Look for closures and openings, I tell them. Disability brings about barriers and hurdles — *closures* in human experience. It also brings the experience of dependence to the generative heart of remaking the built world, a set of *openings* as a cultural inheritance that shapes all of us. These days I also tie those themes to a discussion of the closures and openings more widely made evident under technopoly: What is their own relationship to the digital workplace and its pervasive, liquid, always-on structure? What kinds of sociality are opened up in the apps, and what kinds are distorted or shut down? 

They have plenty of insight for the mixed inheritance of social media. But I wonder if they have the philosophical understanding they would need to take seriously their needs for formation in response to
