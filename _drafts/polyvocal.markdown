This spring I'm teaching my small seminar called Writing About the Built World for grad students in architecture. It's my second run, and therefore infinitely more satisfying than a first attempt. My students are all in thesis mode, save one, so we're both reading widely in criticism and workshopping ways to script and speak about their own work.

So far we've read Michael Sorkin on [Skyscrapers A-Z](https://www.readingdesign.org/skyscrapers), Rachel Kushner on [the pathos of street life](https://harpers.org/archive/2023/08/street-life/), Mark Lamster on [the flattening of suburban design](https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/architecture/2022/09/28/the-flattening-why-everything-looks-like-everything-else/),  Alexandra Lange on [how to be a critic in the first place](https://placesjournal.org/article/how-to-be-an-architecture-critic/). And we'll read so much more. 

The case I keep making to young designers is that they need more than pitch-speak to tell the stories held in the built world. Even if they don't want to do much criticism, they benefit from seeing a variety of rhetorical choices and publishing venues that summon key audiences and leave aside others. I want makers to be conversant in forms of narrative and persuasion and literary sophistication because I want them to be polyvocal.
