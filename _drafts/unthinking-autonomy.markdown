I want to start making some notes about the logic of autonomy as it drives the rhetoric of assisted dying. These will be practical notes more than philosophical: Where are the openings for conversation that would begin at the very beginning, just slightly loosening the fully internalized criterion of *choosing* that is the self-evidently highest good to most late modern people? 

Over lunch with friends, I will state provisionally that this is a thorny subject. Someone will always answer, with unbothered casualness, that for them it's "all about choices," and please pass the salt. It's really that simple for many people I know, including friends who work in medical fields. There's a wealth of rigorous philosophical thinking that is ready to hand for critiquing the end of life as a straightforward matter of autonomous choosing. Many [recent](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/no-other-options) [good](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/canada-legalized-medical-assisted-suicide-euthanasia-death-maid/673790/) words have been written on just this. But no one wants a lecture over lunch. It's much harder to find where one might *begin*: rhetorically, respectfully, relationally.

One place to start that I heard on a podcast: Assisted dying is not an ordinary desire, not a hunger to be slaked. The statistics on general suicide attempts seem to bear this out.
