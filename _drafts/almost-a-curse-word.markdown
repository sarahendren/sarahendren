My daughter, a high school freshman, just started playing lacrosse this year. We can't wait for the season to start. And: she knows that Brian's own tales of youth sports include the enthusiastic yelling of his last name from the sidelines — FUUUUNNNNCK! — in lots of fields and courts. Once a soccer teammate of his got a violation for this name-outburst — the ref misheard an expletive, obviously — and, with some context, soon reversed the call. But it's the best kind of last name for sports fandom. Our daughter is hoping it'll get more use in weeks to come.
