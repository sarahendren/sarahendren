[William Deresiewicz](https://www.persuasion.community/p/how-art-lost-its-way):

>It was Edwin Denby, the leading critic of the previous generation, who remarked that art is an attempt to prolong our experience of pleasure. If so, then criticism is an attempt to prolong our experience of art. In dance’s case, this is a devilishly tricky task: because you have to translate movement into words, the most corporeal art into the most cerebral medium, but even more because of dance’s very evanescence. By the time you get to your desk — by the time you get to the lobby — the thing is gone, and all that’s left is quickly fading memories, or as [Arlene] Croce put it in the title of her first collection, “afterimages.”
