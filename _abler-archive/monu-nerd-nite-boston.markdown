Here's the sticker project in the current issue (_Editing Urbanism_) of [MONU, the Magazine on Urbanism](http://www.monu-magazine.com/), out of Rotterdam. And this coming Monday night I'll be speaking about the sticker project and my work at [Nerd Nite Boston](http://boston.nerdnite.com/2011/07/19/nerdnite-july-25-totally-awesome/)—they're collaborating with the Awesome Foundation for this month's lectures. Nerd Nite hosts regular short talks, usually at a bar, with a DJ before and after—"like the Discovery Channel," they say, "with beer."

With my grant from the [Awesome Foundation](http://awesomefoundation.org/), I was able to amp up the visibility of the sticker image with more opaque ink and order a large new print run. There's a big box in my living room now. Contact me if you want some!
