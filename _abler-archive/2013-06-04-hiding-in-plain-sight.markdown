[![Three figures, seated outside, huddled together in separate black lycra body socks, enveloping their entire bodies.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_huddled.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_huddled.jpg) Soon after I [posted](http://ablersite.org/2013/05/21/normalabnormal-in-prague/) an image of my project [_Unknown Armature: Body Socks_](http://sarahendren.net/2012/01/03/unknown-armature-body-socks/)—that's another one, above—[Duane McLemore](http://www.duanemclemore.com/) pointed me to these "[entoptic phenomena](http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/sets/72157594235409275/)," William Hundley's photoset on Flickr: [![A floating rust-colored sheet of fabric seems to float, unaided, about 4 feet off the ground. The fabric is billowed and folded as though occupied inside, yet there's no evidence of a mass or volume that would occupy it.](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/88/214212878_1e8d6274ed_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/214212878/) [![A silk-satin, hot pink mass of fabric seems similarly occupied by a body, but floats in front of a shop window, unmoored.](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/90/231399930_5dc34dc031_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/231399930/) [![A plain cotton sheet floats above the ground, seems to be inhabited by two human bodies.](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/187/363560296_99525165c9_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/williamhundley/363560296/) [![A pink and blue printed sheet of fabric hangs suspended in the air, mountainous in its shape.

I have [exactly zero sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entoptic_phenomenon) of how these are done, and I love that whatever anthropomorphism is present fades in and out of the set—appearing and disappearing. These images get at something far more effectively enigmatic than mine do. Like I wrote about [here](http://sarahendren.net/2012/01/03/unknown-armature-body-socks/), I've been interested in how dispersed the meaning of a body sock can become.

[![Two body socks are occupied by wearers in a placeless white background.

A body sock is already an informal prosthetic, designed for people with [sensory processing disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder), a condition that isn't recognized in the DSM but widely accepted and treated in schools and clinical settings, and often appearing in tandem with autism spectrum conditions. The sock provides a scrim, a filter for otherwise unregulated and overwhelming sensory stimuli. It allows you to be in public, and explore and play, without having to engage all the crash-bang of unmediated public space.

So I've been testing just how diffuse its meaning can become—that is, using a tool that is resolutely practical in its therapeutic design, but re-contextualizing it, sending it out in search of a new narrative, with a new set of users.

[![In Central Square, Cambridge, two women look on as a third tries on a green lycra body sock. I'm there, speaking with them about the project.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_saraexplaining-600x450.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_saraexplaining-600x450.jpg) [![A woman in Central Square dons the green fabric envelope, while her friends look on.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_tryingon2-600x450.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_central_tryingon2-600x450.jpg) [![A wearer inside the sock on a vast green space stretches and bends her knees against the lycra, dancing with its form.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_sabrina_cityhall.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_sabrina_cityhall.jpg)

In this set of exchanges, I was part performing the role of educator: inviting people to try on this textile costuming, while also talking about sensory processing disorder if asked. But I was also interested in ways to hide in plain sight—indoors and out.

[![A body sock made from stretchy knitted lace, like so many front window curtains. The wearer steps inside the lace envelop and can disappear, perched in the window frame.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_front_window-600x337.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/sock_front_window-600x337.jpg) [![A body sock made of hombre-faded sky blue lycra. The wearer can perform it outdoors, blending into the skyscape behind her.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/blue_sock_close_sky-600x337.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/blue_sock_close_sky-600x337.jpg)

And these experiments took place in the context of Occupy events all over the country, so I was also thinking about these protestors in San Francisco. Ways to become amorphous, present but unreachable. The black blob effect:

[![Several people share a single black body sock, seated on the street in San Francisco with an Occupy event. They resisted police arrest for 10 hours.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/black-blob.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/black-blob.jpg)

So I had some black socks custom made, including a double version, for two wearers:

[![Two wearers share a black double sock in a busy city square, while cars rush by in the background.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sock_double_white_van.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sock_double_white_van.jpg)

[![Three wearers of individual black socks find hiding places in a building's "cubby holes" in its outer wall facade.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_blackweb.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/three_socks_blackweb.jpg)

But Duane also sent me to Kim Walker's [_A Social Exchange_](http://kimberlycwalker.com/k/projects_exchange_show.html#grid), using large swaths of fabric in Exchange Square, a financial district in London that is all but unused on the weekends.

[![In these three images, Kim Walker's performers use a long chartreuse swath of fabric to drape and cover themselves and the underused surfaces of Exchange Square, London.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/kimwalker_act-one-938x1024.jpg)](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/kimwalker_act-one-938x1024.jpg)

This beautiful video shows multiple scenarios and performances with bodies and textiles throughout the space.
