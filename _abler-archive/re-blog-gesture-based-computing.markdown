More gadgetry that wasn't created as adaptive tech, but could be used to extend accessibility for motor-impairments. I think we've seen this idea in the movies; these prototype gloves look promising:

"A pair of lycra gloves — with 20 irregularly shaped patches in 10 different colors — held in front of a webcam can generate a unique pattern with every wave of the hand or flex of the finger. That can be matched against a database of gestures and translated into commands for the computer. The gloves can cost just about a dollar to manufacture, say the researchers."
