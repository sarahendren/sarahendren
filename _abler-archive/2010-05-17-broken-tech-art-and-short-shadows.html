<p><strong>Svetlana Boym's <a href="http://www.svetlanaboym.com/manifesto.htm">Off-Modern Manifesto</a> describes her interest in "broken-tech art"—and this is very much at the heart of <a href="http://www.ablersite.com/2009/11/projects-search-task/">my collaborative work on sensory substitution</a> with Brian Glenney:</strong></p>
<p>"Technology, we are told, is wholly trustworthy, were              it not for the human factor. We seem to have gone full circle: to              be human means to err. Yet, this margin of error is our margin of              freedom. It's a choice beyond the multiple choices programmed for              us, an interaction excluded from computerized interactivity. The error              is a chance encounter between us and the machines in which we surprise              each other. The art of computer erring is neither high tech nor low              tech. Rather it's broken-tech. It cheats both on technological              progress and on technological obsolescence. And any amateur artist              can afford it. <strong>Art's new technology is a broken technology."</strong></p>
<p>And this is not a simple critique of technology, a casting-doubt on its promises. It's something else:</p>
<p>"Broken-tech art doesn't thrive in destruction. At times,              I go so far as to hit my computer, give it a mild spanking, push it              to the limit. I want to handle it manually, like a craftsman handles              his tools but without craftsman's faith in the materials. Yet I never              wish to annihilate the computer and return to the anxieties of leaking              pens and inkblots on the grid-paper of my childhood. <strong>Broken-tech              art is not Luddite but ludic.</strong> It challenges the destruction              with play."<strong></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>And what can this play show us? Broken-tech art is the "art of short shadows":<br />
</strong></p>
<p>"[W]alter Benjamin              wrote about the importance of short shadows. They are 'no more              than the sharp black edges at the feet of things, preparing to retreat              silently, unnoticed, into their burrow, their secret being.'</p>
<p>Short shadows speak of thresholds, warn us against being too short-sighted              or too long-winged. When we get too close to things, disrespecting              their short shadows, we risk to obliterate them, but if we make shadows              too long we start to enjoy them for their own sake.</p>
<p>Short shadows              urge us to check the balance of nearness and distance, to trust neither              those who speak of essences of things nor those who preach conspiratorial              simulation."</p>
