I know we've all seen plenty of blogs devoted to one thing a day [one recipe, one photograph, one new idea]. But [01Mathery](http://01mathery.tumblr.com/) keep inspiring me with their sheer energy and playfulness—they're a team of two young designers, hacking and designing one new object every day.

Here's the Extrasound—photos below. And I couldn't embed the video, but [here's the link](http://01mathery.tumblr.com/post/1166249834) to hear it in action.
