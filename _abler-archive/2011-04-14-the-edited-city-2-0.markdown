Thanks to the [Awesome Foundation](http://awesomefoundation.org/), I have a grant to [tweak the sticker](http://www.ablersite.org/2010/12/life-in-the-edited-city/) and do another print run. My first set went quickly! I'm hoping for reflective ink this time—it wasn't possible with the printer I went with initially, but now I can do some more R&D for maximum visibility.

Seriously, why can't academia function more like the Awesome Foundation? A bunch of interesting—and interested—people pool their resources and support whatever projects they choose. One every month, quick turnaround, anyone can apply, an emphasis on action, and they keep the threshold low by awarding a modest amount, more frequently. Getting ideas off the ground.

There's so much talk now about trans-disciplinary thinking in the university setting, but it sure can seem belabored. Like getting to the end of the annual company meeting and saying, in ritual fashion: We should communicate more about the work we're doing. And then shuffling back off to your own micro-universe until the next annual get-together.

But the Awesome Foundation communicates across subjects and ideas effortlessly, and it creates a possible network of like-minded people that's as valuable as the cash award. I'm looking forward to more sticker work. If you've gotten a packet of them from me, remember: document and email me!
