Matthias Gommel's [_Delayed_](http://www.gommel.com/) places two participants in conversation via headsets–except their communications are postponed for five seconds. No instructions are given when you encounter this work; it's a game of trials and tests and repeats. It's striking to me that this piece originates from 2002, precisely when it would have registered most strongly around the can-you-hear-me-now ubiquity of mobile phones and their attendant stuttering rhythms. In one way, it's a work located in that exact year. But in the museum context, like [this show at SFMOMA](http://www.sfmoma.org/exhib_events/exhibitions/306) from 2009, they become an additional performance as well.
