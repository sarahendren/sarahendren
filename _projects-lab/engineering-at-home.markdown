[Engineering at Home](http://engineeringathome.org/) is an online design archive of adaptations built by, with, and for Cindy, who became a quadruple amputee late in life. It's also a manifesto about what counts as engineering, and who counts as an engineer. Read more on the project [web site](http://engineeringathome.org/).
